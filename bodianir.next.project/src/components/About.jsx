            I'm a designer turned full stack developer, passionate about
            React.js and Node.js. I excel in blending technical and visual
            aspects to craft exceptional digital products, prioritizing user
            experience, precise design, and optimized code. Since starting my
            web development journey in 2015, I've embraced challenges and kept
            up with the latest tech trends. Now in my early thirties, seven
            years in, I'm building cutting-edge web apps using Next.js,
            TypeScript, Nestjs, Tailwindcss, Supabase, and more. With a
            progressive mindset, I enjoy the entire product development process,
            from ideation to execution. Off duty, you'll find me on Twitter,
            tracking startup journeys, or unwinding. Follow me for tech insights
            and public project updates on Twitter or GitHub. Finally, some quick
            bits about me.
